# CinemaNetSystem

This web application is built strictly up to MVC architecture, based on WEB ASP.NET MVC 5 template project.   
## Technologies

On this project i used EntityFramework to build a database with the Code First approach. The database itself contains 3 entities, Countries -> Cities -> Cinemas, which all have 1 to many relationship (1 country-> many cities, 1 city->many cinemas).
Also delete works as a charm, because cascade delete is inplemented.
